# _**Greatest Common Divisor**_

## **Function 1: naiveGCD**

* level: **Beginner**
* implementation: **naive solution**
* idea : **loop** 

>### Problem
    get the greatest common divisor for small and large numbers, example: GDC(8,4) = 4 , GDC(10,4) = 2

>### Algorithm
    - make the user enter the two numbers that he/she want to get their greatest common divisor (GDC)
    - loop from i = 1 to i = the minimum number of the two inputs
        - if i accept the devision on both numbes --> make i is the greatest common divisor (GCD)
    - and then return the result after the loop which will extract to us the greatest common divisor

## **Function 2: fasterGCD**

* level: **Beginner**
* implementation: **faster solution**
* idea : **using recursive with Euclidean Algorithm** 

>### Problem
    get the greatest common divisor for small and large numbers in a faster enhanced way, example: GDC(8,4) = 4 , GDC(10,4) = 2

>### Algorithm
    - make the user enter the two numbers that he/she want to get their greatest common divisor (GDC)
    - recursive function based on Euclidean algorithm --> GCD(a,b) = GCD(a',b) = GCD(a,b') where a' or b is a or b prime that means that a' = a%b , b' = b%a
        - if prime (a%b) == 0 then the GCD = prime 
        - else we will do the fasterGCD again (recursivly) between the prime and b --> GCD(prime,b) and though till we reach our GCD
